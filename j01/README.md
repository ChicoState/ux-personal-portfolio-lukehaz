# Calling and sound
I use discord for communicating and keeping up with friends. Discord's main feature is to join a call with one or many other people via the internet for free. But it has many additional features as well. These include text chats and screen sharing much like slack.

Screen sharing is an instance of **Matching between system and the real world** as conceptually it's like physically showing someone next to you your screen. This feature allows a user to stream whatever is on their computer screen to Discord allowing anyone in a call with them to view that content.

When sharing your screen in Discord it is pretty easy to get started and matched my **mental model** (how I thought it would
work). There is a screen button with an arrow on it that you first need to click. After clicking on it you will be prompted with a few options. You will get the option to stream one of the currently open browser or application windows that is open at the time or your entire screen (meaning everything you stream the viewers can see).

What I would initially think is that anything a viewer can see they can hear. For instance if I were streaming a youtube video, I might think the viewer could always hear it. But this isn't always the case. The **audio streamed to Discord will only be streamed from the selected application.** So, if I were to stream my entire screen and then open a browser, viewers could not hear anything from this browser, which does not match my **mental model**, which assumes whatever I can hear and see a viewer can see. Which is an issue discord users constantly run into. I think the better way to do audio streaming would be to allow any on screen audio to be streamed, lowering the confusion of the user.
